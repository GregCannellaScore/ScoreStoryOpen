# ScoreStoryOpen
ScoreStory Open Source
This is the future home of the ScoreStory open source version. This software was created to provide a low cost alternative for creating queries and and dashboards over data that resides on an IBMi.
In order to compile this project, you will need an IBMi with an RPG compiler.  You will also need Zend Server loaded on your machine.
